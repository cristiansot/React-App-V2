# Project #2: React-App-V2

### **Project Option #3:** **Health and Fitness Tracker**

Create an application focused on personal health and fitness tracking. This app should allow users to log their daily activities, track nutritional intake, set fitness goals, and monitor progress over time.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   **User Info**: Users can add their personal information containing Name, Weight, and Height. This information will be used to personalize the data received in the app.
    -   **Activity Log**: Users can record various physical activities, including the date, duration, intensity, and calories burned. They can also see their past logged activities.
    -   **Weekly Progress Visualizer:** The user can see the activities they logged in a particular week in a simple chart.
    -   **Weekly Goals Setting:** The user can set activity goals for the week by setting a set amount of time on one or multiple activities. Their progress towards their goal is displayed in a simple chart and should be updated automatically when new activities are added.
    -   **Nutrition Intake and Calories Visualizer:** The user's total daily nutrition and calorie intake is displayed in a simple chart. This should update automatically when new data is logged for the day.
    -   **Nutrition Log**: Users can record their dietary intake for each day, along with nutrition and calories. They can also see their past logged meals.
    -   **Nutrition Tracker Visualizer:** The users's daily nutrition breakdown is displayed in a simple chart. They update automatically when new data is logged for the day.
    -   **Meal Planner:** The user will receive 3 meal plan recommendations each day.

## Assignment Details

### Overview: 
In this project, your team will embark on the journey of building a dynamic and interactive web application using React. The objective is to create an application within one of four specified domains: Travel Package Booking, Tech Marketplace, Health and Fitness Tracker, or Hobbyist Network. Each member of the team will be responsible for developing one of the key features of the application, ensuring a collaborative effort that leverages the strengths of each team member. This project is an opportunity to apply your React knowledge in a real-world scenario, working as part of a team to build a comprehensive web application. It will challenge you to think critically about application design, component structuring, and collaborative development, all while creating a functional and engaging product.
    

Each domain comes with its own set of unique challenges and key features that need to be implemented. Your team will decide on the component hierarchy and structure of the application, ensuring that each key feature is effectively developed and integrated into the overall application. Each project domain has been carefully chosen to allow you to build a rich project that you can be proud to show future employers! We highly recommend choosing the one that is most interesting to your team, as you'll be spending many hours on it. 

### Responsibilities:

-   Decide as a team on how the final app will look. It is important to have a unified theme and overall design for all parts of the app.
-   Work as a team to identify how each of the features will be interacting with one another. Although each team member will be taking ownership of one key feature, all parts of the app must work seamlessly together.
-   As a team, decide on the component hierarchy for each feature. You will need to justify your choices, explaining how your chosen structure enhances the application's functionality and user experience.
-   As a team, decide on what kind of data management your app will need, and set up the Mock API for the app. Since some features require more data than others, ensure to approach the dataset development as a team effort. Optionally, you may explore free APIs to populate your app with data (but will still need to create a Mock API for storing app-specific information).
-   Implement your application using React components. Focus on creating reusable components and managing state and props efficiently.
-   Start with a simple design and basic functionality. Once the foundational aspects of your app are working well, progressively add more complexity and advanced features. Pay attention to the user interface and experience, ensuring that the design is intuitive and user-friendly.

### Expectations:

All code that is submitted is your own. Teammates are encouraged support one another's learning, but do not code on someone else's behalf.
By the end of the project, your team should have a working application in your chosen domain. 
Be prepared to explain the reasoning behind your component hierarchy and the structure of your application.
Use Git for version control throughout the project. Your code should be well-documented and pushed regularly to a shared GitHub repository.
Each team will present their application, showcasing the features and explaining the component architecture, state management, and any challenges encountered.
Notes:

The application may seem daunting at first, with many moving parts! It's okay. Make use of Wireframing and User Stories to break down each feature into small achievable tasks. 
Imagine you are building a real-life application! What would your target user want to be able to do in the application? (Feel free to ask friends and family for ideas! Market research is an important step in app development)
The number of Key Features required for the web app depends on the number of team members in your group (3 or 4). 
Since we haven't covered secure user login and user management in detail yet, the applications will be using minimal user management. As you gain further skills, you will be able to update your webpage to have user-specific accounts!
Your team must utilize GitHub features for collaboration throughout the project.
Remember, a simple app that works is much more valuable than a fancy-looking app with bugs! Start simple and weave in one small addition at a time, ensuring that it works before moving on to another. 

Most importantly: have fun!
Project Option #1: Travel Package Booking Platform
Develop a travel-themed application for creating, browsing, rating and booking travel packages.
